<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>The biggest challenge at work so far is trying to find my place while being so junior at the firm. It’s been (and still is) an adjustment.</p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>Networking, having honest conversations with my manager, and my mentoring relationships.</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>When I solve a coding problem that my team wasn’t sure how to solve; it’s honestly the best feeling.</p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>I haven’t really experienced any discrimination. I have however experienced the
 feeling of self-consciousness at the work place because I was a minority. I handled it by taken the weekend to regroup as well as talk to my mentors.</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>I enjoy reading, writing, and exercising. I try to incorporate them before and after work as an opportunity to relax.</p6>
<h2>6. Lauren showed me your blog. What made you decide to create the blog?</h2>
<p7> Wow that’s so great that she showed you! My friend had asked me if I would want to be a part of it with her. The reason why I became so inspired and so passionate about creating the blog is because there isn’t 
really a space for women of color in STEM and often times I feel like they are an ignored demographic as people. The team and I feel that creating a
 space that can inspire, encourage and uplift, other young women in the STEM industry.</p7>
