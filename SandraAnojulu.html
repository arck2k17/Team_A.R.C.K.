<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2> The toughest challenge that I faced in may career was when I relocated to Hong Kong to co-head our Technology Client Services team.  This was a major 
change in terms of learning a few role, new culture and new environment.  It was important to fully integrate in the culture and get to know your team and 
most importantly listen to their needs and concerns.  Secondly, I also focused on creating an operating model that enabled my team in Asia to build inclusive
 relationships with their global counterparts. </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>- Continued investment in my brand and to make sure my brand represents quality products, excellence and integrity.  
-  I always own both my successes and failures.  In life, you will have challenges and make mistakes, it's important to own those mistakes and learn from them.  Do not play the "blame game".  
- Everything I do is with passion, dedication, rigor and purpose.  It's important for me to believe in my work and set a high bar for myself.
- My deep appreciation, trust, respect and love for humanity.  I am a philanthropist at heart.  
</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>What I love the most about my job is the ability to create an entrepreneurial path within Goldman Sachs.  It's nice when you feel ownership with a
 particular area or business within the firm.  When you are able to marry your happiness, values and passion to your work...it's magical and impactful. </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5> I think it's important that acknowledge that discrimination does exist in the workplace, but it also important to know that organizations have resources 
available to deal with these type of situations (ie. Employee Relations (ER) groups in HR, etc.)</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6> My hobbies are, first and foremost being a cool mom to my 2 kids (Joshua and Jessica), traveling and experiencing new cultures, 
dancing, and spending time with my close friends.  Support nonprofit organizations that are focused on creating opportunities for underserved communities.
