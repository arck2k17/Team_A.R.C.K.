<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>For me, one of the biggest challenges at work was just the fear of doing a full-time job and the responsibilities and changes in life that come with it. 
 I had really enjoyed life as a student and it seemed to me that being at work for a large portion of the day, having serious deadlines, and no more summer
 vacations or winter breaks would be the worst!  While not having three months off in the summer and having to show up somewhere five days a week (as opposed
 to skipping lectures in college) still sucks, these changes scare me less than they did before.  This is mostly because if you enjoy what you’re working on 
 and the people that you are working with (as I do!), work can still be fun, even if it isn’t the same kind of fun that school was! </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>I think a relaxed work atmosphere, super helpful coworkers and teammates, and great relationships with the people I work with are key.</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>I have been most satisfied with the help and constant support I’ve gotten from my teammates.  I’m never afraid to ask questions because I know no one 
in my team will be annoyed or judge me for not knowing something!  On top of that, I came in thinking that everything would be about work, work, work and
 any distractions would be frowned upon! But this wasn’t true!  One thing I really like about working with my team is that everyone is very relaxed and we
 spend a big portion of the day just chatting about random things, taking icecream breaks, and doing fun after work activities! :) </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>Can’t think of any incidents, but will let you know if I remember anything!!</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>I really enjoy reading, which I mostly do in my morning and evening commutes! Sometimes I even sneak in a page or two while waiting for code to compile :)
We also have a book club at work, for which we meet once a month to discuss the book we’ve been reading</p6>
