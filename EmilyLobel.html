<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>Not sure about my biggest challenge at work, considering I don't have that much work experience! It's been REALLY tough dealing with this group called
 A.R.C.K. at my Girls Who Code job this year, they are just so efficient and nice to talk to. Really makes my job hard. Since I'm primarily a student, I guess
 I'll answer this question in terms of school. I'm a rising sophomore at Bryn Mawr College. Everyone's freshman year will have ups and downs, no matter how 
 outgoing, extroverted, smart, or ambitious you are. Something that I'll continue to struggle with has been really learning how to study. I've always been a
 procrastinator and I deal with some anxiety in terms of academia, so a lot of the time I put off important things and end up with a lesser product than I 
 should have. I've become better with that this year, but I need to do even more to overcome it fully. A struggle that I've managed to overcome has been 
 finding a great group of friends. I went to the same school for K-12. I'd obviously gone to things over the summer and clearly hadn't lost the ability to
 make friends, but I'd never had to spend the academic year with people who didn't know me. It's been sort of hard and sort of funny to realize that people 
 who I'm just meeting at college don't know everything about me, like the friends who I grew up with did, and there are things I have to explain and be clear
 about. Everyone in their freshman year worries about finding a friend group, and I was really worried about that until around January. Even though I had 
 great friends by October, I still was anxious that I didn't have a core group of friends. By the end of the year, though, I had a core group and more, 
 and learned a lot about how I should go about making new friends.  </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>Being kind to others, not expecting that same kindness back. I'm likely the youngest to be featured as a "spotlight" on your website, so my words should
 be taken with a grain of salt, obviously, but the number one thing that has helped me get work has been connections, and you can't have connections unless
 people like you. It's important to keep up with those connections, too -- keeping in contact, updating them, asking about how they're doing. If you have any
 sort of connection, it's important to take advantage of them. That would be my advice to someone about to enter the workforce.</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>My work with Girls Who Code has been everything I've ever wanted and more! I wanted to be involved with the program myself in 2013, but abstained 
from applying because my school technically did have a Computer Science program, though I wasn't partaking in it. If you'd told me that I'd be interning 
and then teaching my own class the next year, I'd have been thrilled! Last year, as an intern in the Strategy and Innovation department, I got to do research
 for CEO Reshma Saujani on bravery and risk-taking in girls, which was so fun and so interesting. Now, as a T.A. and as a student at a women's college, I get
 to inspire that same bravery and risk-taking in my students and cohorts. It's been so rewarding to be able to change peoples' lives for the better, as that
 has always been an aspiration of mine. I look forward to seeing all the amazing things that my students and cohorts will do! </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>Not at work, since most of it has been with Girls Who Code, but I have witnessed discrimination at school. You'd think there shouldn't really be 
any misogyny present at a women's college, but it is unfortunately an issue we deal with everywhere. I have often times been dismissed by male CS 
professors because they weren't taking me seriously -- since I had an A average in both of my computer science classes this semester and showed up at 
office hours almost every week, I can only assume this was because I was female. They would often cut me off mid-sentence to answer a male student's
 question (we get male students from Haverford College), or even just to laugh at a joke that a male student had told. The only way to deal with it is 
 to make them take you seriously by continuing to persist. The best revenge is success!</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>Until I was 16 years old, I had every intention to get a B.F.A. in Musical Theater. I guess I could call it a hobby now that I'm majoring in 
Computer Science instead, but I am receiving a minor in theater and continuing to pursue it as a possible career option. In May after my senior year, 
I was able to work at this awesome company called the Go Game, which is a company that helps large companies such as Facebook, Netflix, and Adobe do 
company bonding exercises! To do this, they use a combination of a mobile game, which tells teams what their current activity is and how to go about them, 
and live performers to facilitate the game. This was a perfect combination of my two biggest interests, CS and Theater, and I hope to one day work at a 
company like that again. I also love music, which hasn't quite been a part of my work yet, but hopefully I can incorporate it soon. Overall, I don't feel a 
huge need to work at a company that integrates my hobbies; I'm okay with keeping them separate. However, it's a really interesting concept to explore, since 
CS and theater are so different, and maybe one day I'll make my own company that somehow integrates both!</p6>
