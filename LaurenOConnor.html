<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>I think one of the biggest challenges at work has been something I always struggle with in CS in general, and that’s the general fear of not being
 good enough. Computer Science is an intimidating field because of all the different technologies and jargon that’s used, so it can be equally intimidating 
 to try new things. Starting work was especially hard because I didn’t know much yet and was afraid I wouldn’t be able to contribute, or keep up. The best
 way for me to overcome that fear is always to dive in and get my hands dirty – I can never truly understand a technology until I’ve actually worked with it
 hands-on. My first few months I did a lot of researching the GS documentation, reading up on technologies I would have to use, and practice programming 
 little solutions until I became more and more familiar with it. That, plus asking my coworkers to help teach me and to show me examples, was definitely 
 helpful and gave me some comfort in taking on more and more challenging projects and increasing the confidence in my own abilities. </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>The number one thing that helps you succeed at work is the people around you. Technical or soft skills can get help you solve a few problems here 
and there, but having smart and helpful colleagues can help you with all of them. Have a bug in your code you can’t find? Ask someone for help debugging.
 Not sure who to contact in the firm about a certain issue? Ask someone if they know who you can reach out to. Learning a new technology and need resources?
 Ask that analyst friend of yours who’s a pro in it. Want to work on more interesting projects? Let your manager know. Having smart people directly around you 
 is really helpful because you learn so much from them and having a broad circle is also very beneficial because you can reach out to them for a technology 
 your team might be new to.  That’s why people tell you to network all the time!</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>The most satisfying thing about my job is always the ability to contribute. It’s always nice to see my changes in production, and see the user’s positive
 reactions to helping them out or implementing new features to make their lives easier. I love coding for the sake of coding, but what’s more gratifying is 
 definitely seeing that work go into production and get used – to really know I’ve made an impact on the product. </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>I’ve been lucky that I haven’t seen much discrimination at work, but I think one of the biggest issues/solutions to discrimination is just
 identifying it. Sometimes it can be hard to see our own biases, but that’s where we begin in trying to remedy them. A big part of the issues that
 women or minorities face in CS, in particular, I don’t think comes from people who are outright discriminatory. I think a big part of it comes from 
 subconscious or institutional bias – i.e. people are discriminating not because they truly believe women aren’t as good at CS, but just because they 
 don’t realize they’re even doing it. There are a lot of sociology studies, for instance, that focus on people who believe themselves to be fair, but 
 when tested out subconsciously hire more men than women, or more white than black people. So even being aware of our own biases can help us make more
 objective decisions, and is a good place to start.
</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>Running is one of my biggest hobbies, and I’m luckily able to incorporate that into my daily work life because we have a gym here at GS, 
so during my lunch break I usually like to take a mental break to destress and go for a jog. We also have a lot of charitable events that I can participate 
in: for instance I ran as part of a GS relay team in the NYC Indoor Marathon earlier this year for the Armory’s college prep program, and I ran with GS for 
the JP Morgan Corporate Challengge as well. One of my other favorite things to do is games and puzzles, which comes in handy for CS! I like coding because 
it’s almost like doing puzzles for me, it’s fun J. Sometimes at lunch as well, a few of the other new analysts and I will play board games or do the crossword
 together – it really helps get our brains going and also helps for networking with other analysts as well!</p6>
