<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>I have started working in the fall of 2016 at Goldman Sachs, and not so long after I joined I experienced lots of reorganizations that lead to me 
joining a new team and having couple different managers. Those abrupt changes initially left me in a relatively new space that I was not comfortable at. 
However, with supports of my mentors and having proactively trying to learn and adjust to new settings, I was able to turn the challenge into a chance of
 me growing my scope and knowledge. The main lesson I have learned was to always stay positive, explore what supports are available around, be agile, and 
 be open for challenges.  </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>One key word I always have in mind is "motivation". Motivation provides energy and joy to accomplish the goal and with the drive and passion, 
one would willingly put effort towards the goal, which is critical for success. </p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>Solving problems that users are currently facing. </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>I haven't directly witnessed any discrimination at work. However, being in the field that is yet heavily populated by men, I can see that this field 
is still susceptible to discrimination against women. Thankfully, the work I am at currently at has great women leaderships who develop strong women 
community and make me feel well supported, and I do hope to continue their initiatives. </p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>I love to travel and explore new restaurants. With my colleagues, I often go to new places in the city to wander through and dine in new restaurants, 
which creates stronger relationships with them, eventually making work life more fun. </p6>
