<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2> My biggest challenge at work has definitely been confidence and “imposter syndrome.” I constantly have to remind myself that there is no such thing as 
a pity hire, that I was hired for a reason and that I can actively contribute to the success of my team and the firm.  </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>The thing that has helped me succeed the most at work are mentors and friends. It’s important to have people who work just outside of your day to day 
interactions that can provide honest feedback and who you can go to for advice. During particularly tough days, these are the people I reach out to advice 
or just to grab coffee and vent. These connections can also help you find additional responsibilities and help you identify areas of interest you have in 
your career. They are so valuable! </p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4> There are two things I find really satisfying about my job: working with great people and seeing your ideas incorporated into the status quo.
 It’s really rewarding working with smart people who push you to be your best day in and day out. It’s also rewarding to see your ideas put into 
 action and valued by senior leadership. </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>   Luckily, I have never experienced discrimination at work. Unfortunately, a friend of mine at another company has and told me about the interaction.
 She was the only woman in a meeting and tempers starting running high. Her second line manager cursed, then looked at her and singled her out by saying,
 “Oh sorry, I forgot there were ladies present.” He called attention to her gender when it wasn’t necessary. She handled it by looking him in the eye and
 responding, “I don’t give a [fill in the blank].” I thought that was the absolute best way to handle that situation. She called him out on making her feel 
 uncomfortable in that meeting by highlighting her gender and let him know that he couldn’t do something like that in the future. It was a small thing and I
 don’t think the manager meant to make her uncomfortable, but it’s important to address even the small things – that’s how change happens.</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6> I have been a competitive swimmer my whole life and continue to swim competitively. I am on a US Masters swim team and compete Nationally in
 the pool and compete locally in open water races. I love getting to compete in a sport I love and make new friends from all walks of life during my 
 time in the pool! Luckily for me, Goldman Sachs is right next to my team’s pool so I can often sneak workouts in during lunch!</p6>
