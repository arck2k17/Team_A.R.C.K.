<h2>1. What has been the biggest challenge at work and how did you overcome it? </h2>
<p2>The biggest challenge we faced was the financial crisis. It was very difficult to work in an environment where the entire industry felt at risk.
 At that time, Goldman leadership was very effective at creating a calm atmosphere despite very stressful circumstances. I learned a lot from their 
 leadership and try to lead the same way.  </p2>
<h2>2. Can you name a few things that have helped you succeed at work?</h2>
<p3>I believe that legal training is an excellent foundation for an business leader. The legal profession is demanding, requires attention to detail, 
analytical skills, etc. I believe that my legal skills have been an asset to my career.</p3>
<h2>3. What has been the most satisfying thing about your job? </h2>
<p4>The most satisfying part of my job is developing my team. I am a big believer in talent management. I have had the privilege of many extraordinary
 managers who have helped me in my career, so I try to pay it forward. I consider the colleagues who work with me to be dear friends. I am invested in 
 their careers and I am often as excited about their career progress as I am in my own. </p4>
<h2>4. Have you witnessed any discrimination at work and how did you handle it? </h2>
<p5>I think that everyone has unconscious bias. I do. Everyone does. I think that I have been the victim of that bias and a likely a perpetrator too. 
The important thing to remember is that when you have bias and power - then you may be discriminating against someone. This is why it is important to
 be educated and open minded about these mindsets and fight them.</p5>
<h2>5. What are your hobbies and how do you incorporate them into your work? </h2>
<p6>I love travel. In my leisure time I like to visit new places. Moving to Asia with Goldman gave me great opportunities to enjoy my hobby.</p6>
<h2>6.What motivates you to continue doing what you do everyday?</h2>
<p7>I love my job. There is no substitute for that as a motivating factor.</p7>
<h2>7.Youâ€™ve had different positions at GS, which one was the most exciting?</h2>
<p8>Every job I have had at Goldman has been exciting because it had a new dimensions. My first role on the bank loan trading and sales desk was exciting 
because I was new to the firm. Moving to Hong Kong was an awesome experience because I was able to learn so much about our Asia business. In my current 
role, I have been given the opportunity to learn so much about technology and work with very talented engineers.</p8>
